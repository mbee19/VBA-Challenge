# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 Challenge for Morgan Bee

In this challenge, I had help from my tutor, Xolani Mkhaliphi, who helped me set variables for the project and also helped me conceptualize what the assignment was asking of me. 

I also met with classmates Silvia Montana Sinol and Kiley Karecki to work through various aspects of the homework. I used the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT when I got stuck, which led me to realize that I needed to reset the Summary_Table_Row before looping to the next sheet. I referenced this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N67uumB0zI0 to help with looping the code through all spreadsheets. 

I also used code from all the in-class activities that we worked on during class this week throughout my code to help me solve the challenge.
